## Overview
This is an app designed to allow the import of KML files in order to visualize the shapes in those files. I have developed it as a tool to visualize the necessary shapes for [IVAO Webeye](https://webeye.ivao.aero) before uploading them.

### Technologies
The app uses [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org), [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

### Future
Currently in order to visualize a shape it has to be hard-corded into the Map.tsx component but I'm working in a way of importing the file once inside the app and adding basic controls for that file (remove).
